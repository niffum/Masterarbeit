abstract = "A navigation system can increase the speed and accuracy of MR guided interventions that make use of scanners with high-field closed magnets. We report on first needle placement experiments performed with an Augmented Reality (AR) navigation system. AR visualization provides very intuitive guidance, resulting in a faster procedure. The accuracy of the needle placement depends on the registration accuracy of the system. In the present trials, the needle was placed as good as 1mm close to the target center, however in a small number of cases substantially larger errors occurred and were most likely caused by needle bending.",

The surgeon can se e.g. a tumor in its actual location inside the patient. This in-situ visualization, where the computer maps the image information onto the patient, promises the most direct, intuitive guidance for surgical procedures. in thispaper, we discuss technical details of teh system and describe a first pre-clinical evaluation. This fisrt evaluation is very positive and encourages us to get our ready for installation in UCLA's iMRI operating room to perform clinical trials.",

abstract = "Summary
Background
An augmented reality tool for computer assisted surgery named X-Scope® allows visual tracking of real anatomical structures in superposition with volume rendered CT or MRI scans and thus can be used for navigated translocation of bony segments.
Methods
In a feasibility study X-Scope® was used in orthognathic surgery to control the translocation of the maxilla after Le Fort I osteotomy within a bimaxillary procedure. The situation achieved was compared with the pre-operative situation by means of cephalometric analysis on lateral and frontal cephalograms.
Results
The technique was successfully utilized in 5 patients. Maxillary positioning using X-Scope® was accomplished accurately within a range of 1mm. The tool was used in all cases in addition to the usual intra-operative splints. A stand-alone application without conventional control does not yet seem resonable.
Conclusion
Augmented reality tools like X-Scope® may be helpful for controlling maxillary translocation in orthognathic surgery. The application to other interventions in cranio-maxillofacial surgery such as Le Fort III osteotomy, fronto-orbital advancement, and cranial vault reshaping or repair may also be considered."

Developments included: (1) optimization of 3D, MR scan protocols; (2) dedicated segmentation software; (3) optimization of model generation algorithms; (4) interactive, virtual reality visualization. The approach is based on a tool for interactive, real-time visualization of 3D cardiac MR datasets in the form of 3D heart models displayed on virtual reality equipment. This allows the cardiac surgeon and the cardiologist to examine the model as if they were actually holding it in their hands. To secure relevant examination of all details related to cardiac morphology, the model can be re-scaled and the viewpoint can be set to any point inside the heart. Finally, the original, raw MR images can be examined on line as textures in cut-planes through the heart models."

It describes the medical, manufacturing, visualization, path planning, entertainment, and military applications that have been explored. This paper describes the characteristics of augmented reality systems, including a detailed discussion of the tradeoffs between optical and video blending approaches. Registration and sensing errors are two of the biggest problems in building effective augmented reality systems, so this paper summarizes current efforts to overcome these problems. Future directions and areas requiring further research are discussed. This survey provides a starting point for anyone interested in researching or using augmented reality. }
